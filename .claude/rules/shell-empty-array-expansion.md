# Expand a possibly-empty array under set -u

- Expand a bash array that may be empty or unset as `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}`, never a bare
  `"${arr[@]}"`: under `set -u`, bash 3.2 (macOS's shipped `/bin/bash`) treats an empty array as
  an unbound variable and aborts, where bash 5.x does not. `viber/scripts/run-branch.sh:125`
  (`for b in ${br_bases[@]+"${br_bases[@]}"}; do`, with the same shape at its other array loops)
  matches `viber/scripts/commit-task.sh:873` and `viber/skills/commit/scripts/commit-args.sh:131`.
- The break only shows up on the macOS CI leg (bash 3.2), which runs only on a manual
  `workflow_dispatch`, so a bare `"${arr[@]}"` that passes on the Linux/Windows legs can still
  ship broken until that dispatch runs.
