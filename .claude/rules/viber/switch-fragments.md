# Preload a switch fragment where its text belongs

- Call `scripts/switch-text.sh` inline at the exact spot in the body where that switch's text
  belongs, never once at the top composing every fragment for the whole skill. `fixer/SKILL.md`
  preloads `issues-report` at "## Resolving the report" and a separate `issues-diagnosis` call
  further down at the diagnosis handoff payload; `triage/SKILL.md` makes three separate calls
  (`issues-read`, `issues-next`, `issues-publish`) at its three matching steps; `implementor/SKILL.md`
  calls `baseline-run` at the task dispatch step and `baseline-close` at the final test run, each
  where its own text applies, then `memory`, `rules`, `qa`, `cleanup` at the close parts.
