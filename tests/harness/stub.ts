 *  first directory that does (`/bin` on macOS, where `/usr/bin` ships grep and
 *  `/bin` ships bash; ubuntu and Git-Bash keep both in one directory and get a
 *  single entry). Those directories ship the utilities a shell script under
 *  test needs to run at all (bash for its `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang, grep,
 *  head, printf) and nothing a developer installed on top of them, so a host
 *  that happens to carry a real `playwright-cli`, `gh` or `npm` cannot answer -

 *  inherited PATH, which is why starving it first is the only way to assert
 *  absence.
 *
 *  It is not a coreutils-only guarantee: that same directory ships `git` on a
 *  POSIX box (the CI ubuntu leg included), so a script whose behaviour branches
 *  on `git` must hold either way. check-playwright.sh does - its cwd is a temp
 *  dir, which is no repository, so `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` fails there
 *  whether or not `git` resolves and `root` lands on the cwd through either
