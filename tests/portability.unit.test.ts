/*
 * portability.unit.test.ts - a static cross-OS invariant sweep over every shipped
 * script (`*.sh` / `*.ts` outside `tests/` and `docs/`, enumerated from the git index so
 * only tracked, shipped files count): every script has a shebang on line 1
 * (`.ts` exempt - a module with none is only ever `import`ed, never
 * executed), no CRLF line ending anywhere, and the `100755` exec bit
 * whenever a `SKILL.md` or a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` invokes it without an
 * interpreter word (`bash …`/`sh …`) in front. Every `!` preload line and
 * every ```! ``` fenced block in every `SKILL.md` gets its own sweep: a glob
 * character (`?`, `*`, `[`) in a bare (unquoted) argument aborts a whole
 * fork load under zsh's default `nomatch`, so every such argument must be
 * quoted, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`/`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` must be
 * double-quoted (they need variable expansion). Finally, every `#!/bin/sh`
 * script is swept, comment lines stripped, for bash-only syntax that a real
 * POSIX `/bin/sh` (dash, etc.) does not understand.
 *
 * Each rule is a small pure function (file text / mode+path in, a list of
 * violation strings out) with its own self-check proving it fires on a
 * synthetic bad sample - see the "self-check" tests below - so the sweep's
 * green run on this tree is proven meaningful, not just vacuously green.
 *
 * Repo reality: no build, no lint, no npm, no package.json - this file is
 * run directly by Node's native test runner + TypeScript type stripping:
 *   node --test tests/portability.unit.test.ts
