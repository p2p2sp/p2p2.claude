/*
 * nudge-prose.unit.test.ts - pins that the second-reply nudge for a viber agent
 * ending without its output line lives in the SubagentStop hook alone.
 *
 * `hooks/scripts/verdict-nudge.sh` sends the agent back; the skills and the
 * planner's ADR reference keep only their fallback for a second reply without
 * the line (`REASON: no verdict returned`) and, where they never use
 * `SendMessage` any more, do not list it among their tools. The files read here
 * are shipped prompts, whose text is the behaviour. Nothing is spawned.
 *
 * Run directly by Node's type stripping:
 *   node --test tests/viber/nudge-prose.unit.test.ts
