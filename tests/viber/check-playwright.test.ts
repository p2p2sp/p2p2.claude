/*
 * check-playwright.test.ts - proves viber/scripts/check-playwright.sh's fixed
 * two-line report ("playwright-cli: ...", "@playwright/test: ..."), exit 0
 * always, across presence/absence of each tool independently.
 *
 * Exit 0 is the whole point: the script is the `e2e` skill's `!` preload, and a
 * non-zero exit there aborts the skill load, so a host missing both tools would
 * lose the skill instead of being offered the install.
 *
 * PATH isolation: `stubDirs` only PREPENDS to the real PATH, so on a host that
 * already has a real `playwright-cli` on PATH the "not found" cases would flip.
 * Every case therefore pins `opts.env.PATH` to the harness's minimal PATH
 * (`coreUtilsPath` in tests/harness/stub.ts, which carries the full rationale,
 * `git` included), and the found cases prepend one `withStub` dir on top of it.
 *
 * Repo reality: no build, no lint, no npm, no package.json (for THIS repo) -
 * this file is run directly by Node's native test runner + TypeScript type
 * stripping:
 *   node --test tests/viber/check-playwright.test.ts
