/*
 * commit-args.test.ts - proves commit-args.sh's `resolve_commit_selector <raw>`
 * contract: it is a library meant to be SOURCED (not executed), so every case
 * here drives it through a tiny bash wrapper that sources it, calls
 * `resolve_commit_selector "$1"` and prints COMMIT_MODE / COMMIT_PATHS (joined
 * with "|") / COMMIT_ISSUE_REFS, one per line. commit-args.sh is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
 * and uses bash-only constructs (BASH_REMATCH, [[ ]]), so every case runs
 * under `forEachShell("bash", ...)` - never a POSIX shell.
 *
 * Repo reality: no build, no lint, no npm, no package.json - this file is run
 * directly by Node's native test runner + TypeScript type stripping:
 *   node --test tests/viber/commit-args.test.ts
