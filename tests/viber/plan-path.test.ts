/*
 * plan-path.test.ts - proves viber/scripts/plan-path.sh's contract: it is the
 * ONE place a plan path is formed AND the one place the approved plan is put
 * there, so every rule about the run directory
 * `docs/_specs/<yyyy-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss>_<slug>/` lives here and nowhere else.
 *
 * Three properties carry the design. The stamp is taken when the plan LANDS,
 * so a second run of the same slug can never overwrite an earlier plan - it
 * either reports the open run as `state: existing` or mints a fresh stamp. The
 * key it prints also names `.temp/viber/<plan-key>/` and the decomposition
 * beside the plan, so anything but `[a-z0-9-]` leaking out of the slug
 * normalization would reach a directory name and a git path. And `--land`
 * COPIES: plan mode writes the plan into a user-level `plansDirectory`,
 * normally outside the repository, so the source must survive untouched and
 * the landed plan - whose progress lives in the status.md beside it - must
 * never be written over. On the way in the copy loses the template's guidance
 * comments, keeping only the markers the run itself reads.
 *
 * Every resolution also lists, as `open:` lines, the OTHER runs still holding a
 * task that is neither done nor skipped: that is what tells the orchestrator a
 * fresh plan is being landed on top of unfinished work.
 *
 * The caller is trusted to take this output as it stands - the skill never
 * re-verifies it - which makes the printed block and the exit codes (2:
 * unusable argv, 3: nothing to resume, 4: an --into target that is not a
 * draft, 5: the copy failed, 6: the run branch could not be set) the whole
 * interface.
 *
 * Under a `branching:` mode other than off, a first landing puts HEAD on the
 * run branch before anything is copied and prints a `branch:` line after
 * `state:`; those cases run in throwaway git repositories. `--start` is the
 * plan-less, read-only start report of the same situation; `--checkout` puts
 * HEAD on an existing local branch and never creates one.
 *
 * Repo reality: no build, no lint, no npm, no package.json - this file is run
 * directly by Node's native test runner + TypeScript type stripping:
 *   node --test tests/viber/plan-path.test.ts
