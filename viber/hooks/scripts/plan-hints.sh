# plan-hints.sh - viber / UserPromptSubmit hook: plan-writing hints for plain plan mode.
#
# Injects two plan-writing rules into the model's context on every prompt sent
# in plain plan mode: end the plan with a subagent review of the finished
# implementation, and have independent tasks run in parallel subagents. The
# rules' text lives in hooks/content/plan-hints.md, injected verbatim, so a
# wording change never touches this script. A plan
# the viber chain drives needs neither - its implementor already runs
# task-reviewer and parallel coders - so a planner, intent or fixer Skill
# tool_use in the current plan-mode episode (or one whose own EnterPlanMode
# opened it), or a typed /viber:intent or /viber:fixer command in it, silences
# the hint. intent and fixer only hand off to the planner,
# so plan-gate.sh does not count them: its planner-review choice needs the
# planner itself.
#
# Why a hook: the rules only matter while a plain plan is written, so carrying
# them in the session manifest spent context in every session for nothing. The
# hint is soft; plain-plan-review (plan-gate.sh, plain-plan-review: true) is
# what enforces the closing review task.
#
# The episode window and the Skill grep are copied from plan-gate.sh, the grep
# widened to intent and fixer plus their typed commands: keep both in step, a
# rename on either side disarms the other silently. The gate additionally
# requires the planner's frontmatter in the plan file, which this hook cannot
# see (it runs before any plan exists), so a refused planner leaves the hint
# silenced for the rest of the episode - accepted, as the hint is soft.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none - every input arrives on stdin.
#   cwd    : irrelevant; the payload carries an absolute "transcript_path".
#   env    : none read.
#   reads  : the transcript file named by the payload's "transcript_path", only
#            to look for a planner, intent or fixer Skill tool_use, or a typed
#            /viber:intent or /viber:fixer command, in the current episode. A
#            missing or unreadable transcript counts as none. Then
#            ../content/plan-hints.md beside this script (via $0), the hint
#            text; an empty, missing or unreadable file -> nothing printed.
#   stdin  : UserPromptSubmit JSON; "permission_mode" decides. Absent, empty,
#            or any value but "plan" -> nothing printed. Empty stdin -> the same.
#   stdout : nothing, or in plain plan mode
#            {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"UserPromptSubmit",
#             "additionalContext":"<plan-hints.md, trailing newlines cut>"}}
#   exit 0 : always (fail-open: a broken hint must never block a prompt).
#            JSON is read with grep/sed; jq is not assumed.
