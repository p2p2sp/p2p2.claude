# kill-guard.sh - viber / PreToolUse hook on Bash: refuses stopping processes by name.
#
# Inside a viber agent, refuses a Bash command that stops processes by name
# (killall, pkill, taskkill by image name, xargs running kill, kill fed by a
# command substitution) and tells the model to stop only the PIDs it started
# itself, with kill <PID>, then confirm each is gone with kill -0 <PID>.
#
# Why a hook: an agent that hunts processes by name (a leftover test host, a
# dev server) also stops processes it never started - the user's own, or another
# coder's in the shared tree. The instruction in the agents is soft; this is the
# hard edge. The hook never answers allow: anything it does not refuse stays
# with the normal permission flow.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none - every input arrives on stdin.
#   cwd    : irrelevant; no path is read or written.
#   env    : none read.
#   reads  : nothing but stdin. A call whose input does not name a viber: agent
#            returns before any external command runs (bash builtins only).
#   stdin  : PreToolUse JSON. Read: the top-level "agent_type" (present only
#            inside a subagent) and "tool_input.command". Empty, malformed or
#            truncated input, no agent_type, an agent_type not starting with
#            "viber:", or no command -> nothing printed.
#   stdout : nothing, or one line when agent_type starts with "viber:" and the
#            command holds, in command position (the start of the command or right
#            after ; & | ( a backtick, $( or a newline, whitespace allowed):
#              - killall or pkill
#              - taskkill with an /IM argument (any case, one or two slashes)
#              - xargs whose command word is kill (xargs options allowed between)
#              - kill whose arguments hold a command substitution ($( or a backtick)
#            {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse",
#             "permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"<text>"}}
#            kill <PID>, kill -0 <PID>, kill $!, taskkill by PID and a name merely
#            quoted as an argument (grep killall notes.md) are not refused.
#   exit 0 : always (fail-open: a broken guard must never block a command).
#            JSON is read with bash regexes; jq is not assumed.
