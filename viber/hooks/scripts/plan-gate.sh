# plan-gate.sh - viber / PreToolUse hook for ExitPlanMode: the plan review gate.
#
# Armed only when the CURRENT plan-mode episode shows a Write/Edit of a
# plans/*.md file - plan mode names that path itself, so it is the harness plans
# directory unless the project redirects it. The episode then picks its reviewer:
#   - a Skill tool_use for "planner" in the episode, or one whose own
#     EnterPlanMode opened it (the skill is user-invocable: false, so a model
#     dispatch is the only way it runs), AND the plan file opens with the
#     planner's frontmatter `source:` line (an unreadable plan keeps the
#     planner's reviewer) -> the planner-review agent, always;
#   - anything else -> a plain plan-mode plan, gated by the plain-plan-review agent
#     only when config.sh resolves `plain-plan-review: true` for the session's cwd.
# Anything else - no plan write, plain-plan-review off, a plan-mode exit in a session
# that already built a plan - passes untouched. The episode starts after the
# last recorded non-plan permission mode, so a plan approved earlier in the
# session cannot re-arm the gate.
#
# When armed, ExitPlanMode is allowed only if the chosen agent was dispatched
# AFTER the last plan write and returned "VERDICT: PASS", and the plan file has
# not been touched since that verdict (file mtime vs. the transcript timestamp
# on the verdict line - that catches an edit through any channel, not just
# Write/Edit). A verdict of the other reviewer never counts. A "VERDICT: DENIED"
# (the reviewer's tool call was refused) denies with its own next step: grant the
# permission, then review again.
#
# The verdict is read from the LAST completed (dispatch -> verdict) pair, bound by
# the dispatch's tool-use id where the transcript carries it: a re-review after a
# FAIL supersedes it, and a PASS quoted anywhere else never counts as one. An
# id-bearing dispatch binds ONLY to a verdict line carrying that same id - no
# weaker fallback: a foreign verdict (another id, or none) arriving while the own
# review is still running is invisible to the pairing, so ExitPlanMode stays
# denied with "let the review finish" until the matching verdict lands. A
# dispatch line that carries no id at all keeps the older, looser pairing: the
# first verdict line after it.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none - every input arrives on stdin.
#   cwd    : irrelevant; the payload's own "cwd" key is the session directory.
#            It resolves a RELATIVE plan "file_path" the transcript records,
#            and is where ../../scripts/config.sh runs to read plain-plan-review. No
#            "cwd" key -> plain-plan-review is off.
#   env    : none read.
#   reads  : the transcript file named by the payload's "transcript_path", the
#            config.sh output for the session's cwd (plain plan only), and,
#            once the plan write line resolves a path, the plan file itself:
#            its frontmatter (planner ownership), then existence and mtime
#            (the tamper guard below).
#   stdin  : PreToolUse JSON with at least { "transcript_path": "<abs path>" }
#   stdout : {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse",
#             "permissionDecision":"allow"|"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"..."}}
#   exit 0 : always. Every parse miss or unreadable file falls back to allow -
#            a broken gate must not trap the user in plan mode - except the plan
#            file under a planner signal: a miss there keeps planner-review
#            rather than loosening the gate to the plain path. JSON is read with
#            grep/sed/awk; jq is not assumed. A malformed or empty result from
#            any read (including a broken awk on PATH) fails open the same way.

# Which review owns this plan. The planner skill running picks its own reviewer:
# a Skill tool_use is the only form it can take - the skill is user-invocable:
# false, so no typed command ever loads it. An escaped mention inside some other
# tool's payload cannot match: `\"skill\":\"planner\"` carries a backslash where
# the pattern needs the quote. Only viber's own install form arms the gate: bare
# "planner" or "viber:planner" - another plugin's "xyz:planner" is not this one.
#
# The planner loads in normal mode and calls EnterPlanMode itself, and Claude Code
# can flush the old permission mode mid-turn between the two, which puts the Skill
# line before episode_start. So the planner also owns the episode when the first
# signal after its Skill line is its own EnterPlanMode tool_use and that entry lies
# inside the episode. A user prompt or a plan-mode record reached first ends the
# pending entry: a refused planner followed by a new request stays out.
#
# The Skill signal alone is not ownership: a refused planner followed by a plain
# plan in the same episode would otherwise hand that plan to planner-review. The
# planner writes a `source:` key into the frontmatter of every plan, draft
# included, and a plain plan-mode plan never carries one, so the plan file itself
# must open with that frontmatter. A plan path that resolves to nothing, or a
# file that cannot be read, keeps planner-review: a read miss never loosens the gate.

# Dispatch line: an Agent tool_use carrying "subagent_type":"<agent>" - or
# "viber:<agent>", the prefixed form a plugin-shipped agent gets - plus its
# "toolu_..." id when the line exposes one.
# Verdict line : the agent's own report - inline as a tool_result, or, for a
# background agent, inside the <result> of its task-notification. The verdict must
# open a line (escaped \n), a content string, or the <result> element, and its value
# must end the token, so a quoted "VERDICT: PASS is not..." cannot pass as one.

# verdict line missing that id (another dispatch's, or none at all) is skipped
# outright, never kept as a fallback, so a foreign VERDICT while the own review is
# still in flight cannot be mistaken for it. A dispatch line with no id at all
# falls back to the first verdict after it, as before; the later completed pair
# wins either way.
