# Configuring viber

`/viber:setup` writes `.claude/viber.yml`, with a comment on every key. This page is the full
reference. Back to the [viber guide](../README.md).

## How the file works

- Switches sit in three groups: `planning:`, `build:` and `github:`. A switch counts only inside
  its group: one written at column 0 or under another group reads as off.
- Only `true` counts as on. Turn a switch off with `false` instead of deleting it.
- Without the file, every switch is off.
- Run `/viber:setup` again after an upgrade. It merges in any switch the new version added, moves
  a switch written outside its group into it, and keeps every value you set. A session start tells
  you when the file's `schema:` number says that run is needed.

## Switches

`/viber:setup` turns seven of the ten on and `build.qa`, `github.issues` and
`build.baseline-tests` off.

| Switch | Default | When on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning.adr` | on | A decision worth keeping becomes an architecture decision record in `docs/adr/`. |
| `planning.plain-plan-review` | on | A plan written in plain plan mode, without the planner, must pass a review before plan mode can be left. |
| `planning.fast-path` | on | A small, well-scoped change to existing code gets a short design in chat instead of a plan. |
| `build.baseline-tests` | **off** | Takes `off`, `fast` or `full`. Runs your tests before the first task, so the build repairs only the failures it caused. |
| `build.final-review` | on | One reviewer checks the whole build's diff after the last task, and a coder fixes what it finds. |
| `build.memory` | on | The build closes by updating your `CLAUDE.md` files below the root. |
| `build.rules` | on | The build closes by recording a convention it confirmed in `.claude/rules/`. |
| `build.qa` | **off** | The build closes by writing test scenarios that `/viber:e2e` can automate. |
| `build.cleanup` | on | The build closes by archiving the run with its summary and dropping the working files. |
| `build.extensions` | empty | Not a switch: a map of your own agents, run at the close of a build. |
| `github.issues` | **off** | Commands can start from a GitHub issue, and an interview can save its conclusions as a new one. |

### Switch details

- **`planning.fast-path`**: `/viber:intent` shows the design and builds it only after your
  explicit yes, with no plan file and no run directory.
- **`build.baseline-tests`**: records what already fails before the first task. `fast` runs the
  unit and component tests, `full` every layer but end-to-end. `setup` rewrites an older `true` to
  `full` and `false` to `off`.
- **`build.final-review`**: runs after every task is committed and before the final test run. It
  looks for what per-task review and the test suite cannot see. A reviewer rechecks the fix; after
  a failed recheck, the arbiter rules on committing the fix as it stands, recorded in
  `rulings.md`. The build summary lists each finding, what was wrong and what the fix changed.
- **`build.memory`**: the root `CLAUDE.md` stays yours. The build only suggests changes to it.
- **`build.cleanup`**: first notes anything the build delivered that the specification does not
  promise. What it archives is described in [Where viber writes](files.md#the-archive).
- **`build.extensions`**: one entry per agent from your project's `.claude/agents/`, run in that
  order just before the run is archived. An entry runs alone unless it holds `parallel: true`:
  consecutive such entries run together in one message, as one step. Empty runs none.
  `/viber:extension` creates an agent and its entry for you.
- **`github.issues`**: `/viber:intent`, `/viber:fixer` and `/viber:prototype` can start from an
  issue's number or link. `/viber:prototype` can post its conclusions to the issue it started from.
  `/viber:triage` can fetch from and publish to an issue, not only work on pasted text.

## Personal overrides

To change a few settings for yourself only, create `.claude/viber.local.yml` in the same layout.

- It overrides four keys and nothing else: `tiers.min`, `tiers.max`, `build.baseline-tests` and
  `github.issues`.
- An empty or invalid value is ignored.
- The file stays out of git (`/viber:setup` adds it to `.gitignore`), and `/viber:setup` never
  creates or changes it.

## Model tiers

The `tiers:` group sets the model range a build runs with: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` or `fable`.

```yaml
tiers:
  min: haiku
  max: opus
```

- Every task, review and retry stays inside the range: `min: sonnet` never runs Haiku, and
  `max: sonnet` never runs Opus.
- Fable runs only when you name it: `max: fable` lets retries climb to it, and `min: fable` with
  `max: fable` runs the whole build on it.
- Planning is not affected: it runs on your session's model.

## Titles and directories

| Key | Default | Sets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github.issue-title` | `'{summary}'` | The title of an issue viber opens |
| `github.pr-title` | `'[{issue-number}] {summary}'` | The title of a pull request viber opens |
| `directories.runs` | `_specs` | The directory under `docs/` for a run in progress |
| `directories.specifications` | `specs` | The directory under `docs/` for the archive |

## Branching

The `branching:` group says whether a run works on its own git branch.

```yaml
branching:
  mode: off
  work:
    main:
      base: main
      name: '{type}/{slug}'
      target: main
```

| `mode` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `off` | Stay on the branch the run started on. |
| `allowed` | A run may get its own branch. |
| `required` | A run always gets its own branch, never an entry's base. |

- Several kinds of branch can be described, each with its own base, name pattern and pull request
  target. The type of the GitHub issue a run starts from picks the kind, through
  `issue-type-mappings`.
- Under `allowed` and `required`, the entry is settled when the interview or diagnosis starts,
  before any code is read, with an offer to switch to its base first.
- No branching step fetches, pushes, merges or deletes. Only `/viber:create-pr` pushes, on your
  yes.

[BRANCHING.md](../BRANCHING.md) has the full schema, one example per branching strategy (trunk
based development, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, Release Flow and GitFlow), and the pull request
template convention `/viber:create-pr` reads.
