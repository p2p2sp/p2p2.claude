# extension.sh - the facts and the one write the `extension` skill needs: which
# agents the host project has, which of them carry the extension marker, what
# `build.extensions` lists, and the registration of one more name.
#
# It exists because the skill must not parse `.claude/viber.yml` or read every
# agent file itself: the list state comes from config.sh, the one parser of
# that file, and the one insertion of a map entry is a deterministic text
# change, so a model never rewrites the configuration by hand.
#
# The file is resolved against the REPOSITORY ROOT, like config.sh: a session
# started in a subdirectory still finds the project's own `.claude/`. Outside a
# repository the cwd is the base.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none -> the report below. `--add <name>` -> register <name>.
#            Anything else -> the report.
#   cwd    : any directory inside the host project - the repository root is
#            resolved here. Outside a repository, the cwd is the base.
#   env    : none.
#   file   : <root>/.claude/viber.yml (read; `--add` inserts two lines into its
#            `extensions:` map), <root>/.claude/agents/*.md (read). No other
#            file is read or written.
#   stdout : no argument -> these lines, in this order:
#              CONFIG=ok | no-config | stale
#              LISTED=<name>, <name> | none
#              MISSING=<name>, <name> | none
#              AGENT=<name> | contract | plain
#            CONFIG is `no-config` without a viber.yml, `stale` when the file
#            has no `extensions:` key directly under `build:`, else `ok`.
#            LISTED is config.sh's `build.extensions` steps with every ` + `
#            written as `, `: a plain list of the entries with an agent file in
#            run order. MISSING is `build.extensions-missing`: the entries
#            without one (or invalid), `none` when empty. AGENT is one
#            line per .claude/agents/*.md, sorted by name (byte order), the name
#            being the file name without `.md`; `contract` when the file holds a
#            line that is exactly `<!-- viber:extension -->` (trailing blanks
#            allowed), else `plain`.
#            `--add <name>` -> one line:
#              STATUS=added | present | no-config | stale | invalid-name
#            invalid-name: <name> does not match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`. Then
#            no-config, then stale (as CONFIG). present: the name is already an
#            entry of the `extensions:` map, wherever its agent file stands and
#            whatever its option - nothing is written. added: two lines go in
#            after the last map line that is neither blank nor a comment (right
#            after the `extensions:` line when the map holds none): the entry
#            `<name>:` at the map's entry depth (the `extensions:` line's
#            indentation plus two spaces for an empty map) and, two spaces
#            deeper, `parallel: false`. Both lines end in CR LF when the
#            `extensions:` line does; every other line, a comment on the
#            `extensions:` line included, stays byte-identical. Every refusal
#            leaves every file untouched.
#   exit   : ALWAYS 0 (a refusal is a STATUS= line; the caller reads stdout only).

# The extension map under `build:`, found by the same rule as config.sh (the
# mapline function below is a copy of its one): the first `extensions:` key line
# among the indented lines of `build:` owns the map, whose lines run up to the
# first line neither blank nor a comment indented no deeper than that key line.
# The first key line of the map sets the entry depth; a key line at that depth
# is an entry named by the key. The name arrives as ENVIRON["EXT_NAME"], the
# mode as ENVIRON["EXT_WRITE"]. Mode 0 prints `P` when the name is an entry,
# `A` when the key is there without it, nothing when there is no key. Mode 1
# prints three lines: the number of the line the new entry goes after (the last
# map line that is neither blank nor a comment, else the key line), the number
# of the key line, and the entry indentation followed by a `|`. The splice
# itself is done by the shell, because some awk builds read a CR LF file in text
# mode and drop its CR.
