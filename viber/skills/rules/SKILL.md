# rules

```!
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rules-map.sh"
```

The block above is this host project's rules layer as the script measured it; a kind of line with nothing to report printed none.

It is self-verifying and trusted. Never re-count a rule, never glob the tree to check what a scope matches, never run git to decide what is dirty: every fact you route on is already above.

Your whole tool set is `AskUserQuestion`, `Agent`, `SendMessage` and the two map lines of step 3. You open no file and you write none: every byte of the layer is written by `viber:rules-writer`, nothing here is staged and nothing is committed.

## 1. Report the layer

Before any question, one line per fact worth deciding on:

- each `rule:` line with its size, its globs and its match count. `OVER-FILE` is past 4000 bytes, and `total:` closes on `OVER-DIR` past 40000 over the directory. A rule already over a budget is reported here and compacted or split by the writer, never by you.
- each `frozen:` line, named as a file this command reports and never scores, audits, resets or rewrites.
- each `dead:` line, named as a rule whose declared scope matches no tracked file.
- each `dirty:` line with its `modified` or `untracked` word.

The root of the directory holds the shared rules, each subdirectory one area's. Name each root `rule:` line whose globs all stay inside one area, or whose basename carries an area as a prefix: the writer moves it into that area's directory.

A `rule:` line whose `paths` field reads `none` declares no scope: it binds the whole repository, is loaded on every task and is never dead.

## 2. Route on the state, then the mode

`state: none` means the directory is absent or carries no scored rule. Say the layer is empty, ask nothing, and go to step 4 with the repository root as the single scope to propose for: there is nothing to review and nothing to reset.

Otherwise one `AskUserQuestion`, the four modes in that single call:

- `review` - verify the existing rules against the files their globs match.
- `extend` - propose the rules a scope carrying none still needs.
- `both` - the rules and the proposals in one pass.
- `reset` - delete rules, then start from zero.

An argument naming one of the four is that answer already: take it and ask nothing. On `state: complete` lead with the flags and the dead rules, every rule declaring a scope; on `state: partial` lead with how many rules declare no scope at all.

`reset` goes to step 3. Every other mode goes to step 4, its target list being the `rule:` lines on `review`, the scopes to propose for on `extend`, and both on `both`. The map lists no candidate scope, a rule's reach being its globs rather than where its file sits: on `extend` ask the user which directories to propose for, the repository root standing in when they name none.

## 3. Reset

The list is every `rule:` line, or the ones the user named. A `frozen:` line never enters it, whatever the user names. Print the list whole, one path per line: a reset deletes this project's rules.

A path in the list that also carries a `dirty:` line refuses the whole call. Name each offending path with its own word, say the user commits or discards that work and runs the command again, and stop there. A refusal is never narrowed into a smaller reset that goes ahead, and uncommitted work is never corrected into something deletable.

Otherwise one `AskUserQuestion` over that exact list. On anything but approval, stop. On approval, one literal line, every path double-quoted, no interpreter word in front of it and nothing chained after it:

```
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rules-map.sh" --reset "<path>" "<path>"
```

- exit 0 -> the `removed:` lines are the deletion. Report them, then map the layer again with the one literal line `"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rules-map.sh"`. That fresh map, its `id:` included, replaces the one above for the rest of the run: the preloaded one still lists the deleted rules. Continue into step 4 with the scopes to propose for as the target list, the repository root among them.
- exit 3 -> nothing at all was deleted. Repeat its `refused:` lines verbatim and stop.
- exit 2 -> the call itself was unusable. Report it and stop.

## 4. Approve the targets

Nothing is dispatched before the user has seen the target list and kept what belongs in it. Show it, one line per target, carrying what step 1 already measured for that path.

Then one `AskUserQuestion` over that list: all of them, or the ones the user picks. Offer the targets themselves as options while the list is short enough to show; past that, offer all of them, none of them, and take the paths a free answer names verbatim. A target the user dropped reaches no auditor and no writer. Nothing kept -> stop, having dispatched nothing and written nothing.

A dead rule is offered like any other: the auditor decides whether its scope really went, and the writer is what removes the file.

## 5. Audit

One `Agent` call per approved target, `subagent_type: viber:rules-auditor`, no `model:` line - the agent's own frontmatter is its strength. The calls go out in batches: at most 16 in one message, run in parallel, the next message only after every call of the previous one returned. A call the harness refuses with `Concurrent subagent limit reached` never ran: it goes into the next message, no later message carries more calls than the previous one had accepted, and it is neither a missing output line nor a `VERDICT: DENIED`. Five labelled lines each and nothing else:

```
target: <the rule's own path, or the literal none for a scope with no rule>
scope: <the globs the map printed for that rule, or the directory to propose for>
matches: <the n of that rule's `matches <n>` field, or the literal none for a scope with no rule>
out: .temp/viber/<id>/
refs: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references
```

`<id>` is the `id:` value of the map above. A rule whose `paths` field reads `none` gates the whole repository: pass `**` as its scope and `none` as its matches. A scope with no rule is the proposing direction: `target: none`, `scope` that directory, `matches: none`, and only missing conventions can come back.

Each call returns one line:

```
AUDIT: <area> stale <n> gone <n> unverifiable <n> drop <n> miss <n> -> <findings file> | none
```

Report the `AUDIT:` line for each target verbatim. Read none of those files - the writer does.

An `Agent` call here or in step 6 that returns none of its output lines (no `AUDIT:` line from an auditor, no `VERDICT:` line from the writer) gets one `SendMessage`, `Finish your task, then return your output lines.`; a second reply without one is that step's `VERDICT: DENIED` with `REASON: no verdict returned`.

A call returning `VERDICT: DENIED` instead -> one `AskUserQuestion` naming the target and the refused call from its `REASON:` line: permission added and retry, drop that target, or stop.

## 6. Confirm, then the writer

Every returned line carrying five zero counters, or `-> none`, with no kept rule named in step 1 as misplaced, no kept rule flagged `OVER-FILE` and no `OVER-DIR` on `total:`, means the layer is already true and no scope earned a new rule. Say so in one line, dispatch no writer, and stop.

Otherwise one `AskUserQuestion` over the counters just reported, the over-budget flags and the moves named in step 1: fold them in, or stop. Only on approval, one `Agent` call, `subagent_type: viber:rules-writer`, no `model:` line, three labelled lines and nothing else:

```
map: <the map's id:, state: and total: lines plus every rule: and dead: line of a kept target, verbatim>
notes: .temp/viber/<id>/
refs: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references
```

`VERDICT: DENIED` -> one `AskUserQuestion` naming the refused call from its `REASON:` line: permission added and retry, or stop.

## 7. Report

Repeat what the writer returned and add nothing to it:

- `FILES:` -> the rules it created, corrected, moved or removed, one path per line.
- `OVER:` -> repeat each line verbatim.
- `MOVE:` -> repeat each line verbatim: a fact removed from a rule that its `CLAUDE.md` node does not hold yet. This run never writes that node; `/viber:memory` over those paths records it, except the root `CLAUDE.md`, which is the user's to record: `/viber:memory` only suggests a change to it.
- `VERDICT: NONE` -> nothing in the layer needed changing.
- `VERDICT: DENIED` -> its `REASON:` line verbatim.
- each target dropped in step 5 on `VERDICT: DENIED`, with its `REASON:` line.

Close on one line: those files sit in the working tree, unstaged and uncommitted, and committing them is the user's next step.
