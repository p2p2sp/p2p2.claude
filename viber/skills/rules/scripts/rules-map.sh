# rules-map.sh - every deterministic fact about the host project's
# `.claude/rules/` directory, and the one gate in front of deleting a rule
# file.
#
# It exists because `/viber:rules` has to know what the layer IS before it asks
# the user anything: which rule is past its budget, which one declares a scope
# that matches nothing, which one is frozen, and what the whole directory costs
# a reader. Measured in the model that is character counting done in prose,
# which is how a budget report ends up wrong. The map is also a `!` preload,
# and a preload is permission-checked as ONE command: a compound `ls | wc |
# git` would ask for approval per member and stall the skill load on any mode
# that does not auto-accept.
#
# The delete lives here for the opposite reason - it has to be able to REFUSE.
# A reset is judged as a whole, one unfit target leaving every file in place,
# because a half-deleted layer is a state neither the user nor the command that
# printed them the list can describe afterwards.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none                  -> map mode.
#            --reset <path> [...]   -> reset mode, repo-relative paths.
#            anything else          -> refused, exit 2.
#   cwd    : any directory inside the host project - the repository root is
#            resolved here and every printed path is relative to it. Outside a
#            repository the cwd IS the root and nothing is tracked there.
#   env    : none.
#   reads  : <root>/.claude/rules/**/*.md - every file at any depth, the root
#            holding the shared rules and each subdirectory one area's, its
#            frontmatter and its size; the git index - which of them are tracked, modified or
#            untracked, and how many tracked paths a rule's globs match.
#   writes : nothing at all in map mode. In reset mode, and only once every
#            target has passed, the given files are deleted from the working
#            tree, and a subdirectory left empty by them is removed with it.
#            Nothing is ever staged and nothing is ever committed.
#   stdout : map mode, in this order. A section with nothing to report prints
#            no line at all; `total:` always prints.
#              # viber rules map
#              id: <yyyy-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss>
#              state: none | partial | complete
#              rule: <path> <chars> paths <glob>[,<glob>] matches <n> ok
#              frozen: <path> <chars>
#              dead: <path>
#              dirty: <path> modified | untracked
#              total: <chars> ok | OVER-DIR
#            `id` is this run's stamp, which the caller spends as
#            `.temp/viber/<id>/`; it reads `unknown` only when the clock cannot
#            be read at all.
#            `state` is `none` when the directory is absent or holds no
#            non-frozen `.md`, `complete` when every non-frozen rule declares a
#            frontmatter `paths:` key, `partial` otherwise.
#            `rule:` is one line per non-frozen `.md`, alphabetical by full
#            path, so an area's rules print together. `paths`
#            carries the declared globs comma-separated, or `none` when the key
#            is absent or declares nothing usable - a rule Claude Code loads
#            everywhere. Then `matches <n>`, the tracked files those globs
#            really match, a `{a,b}` group matching either branch. The line
#            closes on `ok`, or `OVER-FILE` past 4000 bytes.
#            `frozen:` is one line per `_*.md`: reported, never scored, never
#            dead, never deleted.
#            `dead:` is a non-frozen rule whose globs match no tracked file -
#            never one that declares no scope, and never
#            printed at all when the repository tracks nothing, where every
#            rule would read dead and the count would say nothing about the
#            rule.
#            `dirty:` covers every `.md` in the directory, frozen included:
#            uncommitted work is a fact about the file, not a score.
#            `total:` sums every `.md`, frozen included, and closes on `ok` or
#            `OVER-DIR` past 40000 bytes.
#
#            reset mode prints one of two blocks. Refused, nothing deleted:
#              refused: <path> not-a-rule | frozen | missing | untracked | modified
#              refused: - no-target
#              refused: <arg> unknown-mode
#            or, only once every target passed:
#              removed: <path>
#              removed: <n>
#   exit   : 0 - map mode, ALWAYS, whatever it finds: it is called as a `!`
#                preload, where a non-zero exit aborts the whole skill load.
#                Also a reset that deleted every target it was given.
#            2 - unusable argv: a first argument that is not `--reset`, or
#                `--reset` with no target at all.
#            3 - the reset was refused. Nothing was deleted.
