# Security lens
Audits exploitable flaws: an attacker-controlled input that reaches a sink, a missing or wrong authorization, a credential check an attacker can guess or fail past, a leaked secret, broken cryptography. A wrong result or logic error without an attacker belongs to the bugs lens, a slow path to the runtime performance or web performance lens, a weak test to the tests lens, and structure without an exploit to the design lens.

## Hunts
### injection
SQL and NoSQL, OS command, `eval`, template (SSTI), expression language, LDAP, XPath, header (CRLF), XXE and XSS. Trace each sink back to an entry point: source, propagators, sanitizer, sink. A sink with no source an attacker controls is not a finding.

### access-control
Missing or wrong authorization: an object ID read from the request with no ownership check, a route left out of the auth middleware, session fixation, CSRF on a state-changing route, CORS reflecting any `Origin` with credentials, a `postMessage` handler with no origin check, mass assignment, a business rule the server takes from the client or lets a direct call skip (a price, quantity or discount read from the request, a payment, approval or verification step a request bypasses, a single-use or limit check (coupon, balance, invite, code) that parallel requests pass more than once). Compare each route or GraphQL resolver with its siblings: the outlier is the bug.

### authentication
A login, OTP, password-reset, token or signature check an attacker beats: no attempt limit or lockout on a password or a short code (GraphQL aliases and batching count as attempts); a check that fails open (a caught exception, a timeout, a missing claim or an unreachable auth service that lets the request through); JWT `alg` or key confusion, or `exp`, `iss` or `aud` unchecked; OAuth or OIDC without `state`, nonce or PKCE, or a `redirect_uri` matched by prefix; a webhook accepted without verifying its signature; a reset link built from the request's `Host` header. A finding names the guess count or the failure that opens the check.

### untrusted-data-to-machinery
Untrusted data reaching files, the network or objects: path traversal (checked before canonicalizing, or through archive entries or symlinks), unrestricted upload, SSRF where the attacker picks host or scheme, or an allowlist checked on the raw string, before DNS resolution or before redirects, unsafe deserialization (`pickle`, `yaml.load`, `ObjectInputStream`, `unserialize`, `BinaryFormatter`, `Marshal.load`, `TypeNameHandling`). In C, C++, unsafe Rust or cgo: an attacker-controlled length, index or format string reaching a copy, an allocation or pointer arithmetic.

### secrets-crypto-and-supply-chain
Committed live credentials and private keys, weak or attacker-chosen algorithms, ECB, a static IV or nonce, tokens from a non-CSPRNG, TLS verification off, `==` on a MAC, dangerous defaults (an empty key that skips the check). Secrets or PII in logs and responses, debug endpoints left on, CI workflows running untrusted PR code with secrets (`pull_request_target` or `workflow_run` plus a checkout of the PR head or its artifacts) or interpolating an attacker-set `${{ github.event.* }}` field into `run:` or a script, install scripts fetching unpinned code.

### llm-and-agents
Untrusted text (a message, page, file, issue, email or tool result) reaching a model that can call a tool with side effects or read data its sender may not, with no allowlist or human approval on that call; user input in a system prompt; model output reaching a shell, `eval`, SQL, a path or rendered HTML or markdown (a remote image URL exfiltrates). In agent, skill, hook and CI configs: an unrestricted shell or write tool, or a wildcard trigger, on a flow that reads untrusted content.

## Excluded
- Denial of service, resource exhaustion, rate limiting (an attempt limit on a credential or code check excepted), resource leaks: a crash or hang belongs to the bugs lens, time and memory growth to the runtime performance lens, ReDoS included.
- Missing hardening, best practice or input validation with no concrete exploit.
- Version-only dependency findings.
- Memory safety in memory-safe code: safe Rust, pure Go, managed languages.
- Code used only by tests; documentation files, except a markdown file a tool runs or loads as agent instructions (skill, agent, command, hook).
- Log spoofing, missing audit logs.
- Regex injection; SSRF controlling only the path; user content in a prompt of a model that holds no tool, secret or data beyond its sender's own.
- Auth checks missing from client-side code.
- XSS in React or Angular without `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `bypassSecurityTrust*` or similar.
- Races and TOCTOU with no proof that parallel requests or an attacker-written value hit the window; timing attacks other than a byte-wise compare of a MAC or token.
- Attacks needing control of env vars, CLI flags or install-time config.
- Secrets on disk that are otherwise secured; guessing UUIDs.
- Tabnabbing, XS-Leaks, prototype pollution and open redirect, unless the chain is concrete.
- Shell scripts, notebooks and CI workflows, unless untrusted input demonstrably reaches them.

## Verify
Worktree: required

Oracle: with attacker-controlled input at a real trust boundary, the claimed security property is observably violated.

1. Restate the claim in one sentence: source, path, sink, impact, attacker position. A claim that cannot be restated coherently: REFUTED.
2. Trace backward from the sink: list every hop and every validator, sanitizer, framework auto-escape and auth check on the path. For an authorization claim, cite where the intended rule comes from (a sibling route's check, a test, a doc or an owner field); with none, INCONCLUSIVE.
3. Execute in the clean worktree: a unit test or script calling the vulnerable function with the payload; otherwise start the unit on localhost with local stubs or SQLite. A concrete symptom is needed: an injected clause executes, a marker file appears, a file outside the root is read, the wrong principal is allowed, the hundredth wrong guess is still checked, a forced exception lets the request through, a secret shows in output, N parallel requests redeem one single-use value N times, a sanitizer (ASan, UBSan) report, a stubbed model returning the injected tool call makes that tool run with no approval.
4. A claim that cannot be executed passes six gates, each with cited lines: reachability, attacker control, real impact, PoC trace, bounds or math, no environmental block.

Verdicts:
- VERIFIED: the PoC shows the symptom, or all six gates pass with every hop read. Never VERIFIED on a pattern match alone.
- PARTIALLY VERIFIED: real, but the precondition or impact is weaker than claimed; state the corrected scope.
- REFUTED: any gate fails with cited evidence.
- INCONCLUSIVE: a hop is unreadable (reflection, DI wiring, generated code, proxy, WAF or config), the PoC needs a live external service or real credentials, or the existence of a deserialization gadget chain is unknown.

## Severity
- 9-10: pre-auth RCE, auth bypass to admin, cross-tenant read or write at scale, a committed credential in a recognized provider format, not a placeholder or test fixture, prompt injection that makes an agent run a shell or send other users' data out, a CI workflow that runs attacker code holding write tokens or release secrets.
- 7-8: authenticated RCE or injection, IDOR across users, SSRF to internal hosts or cloud metadata, stored XSS in a privileged view, arbitrary file read or write, unlimited guesses on a reset or OTP code, a paid or approved action obtained without paying or approval.
- 4-6: needs user interaction or a specific precondition: reflected XSS, CSRF (7-8 when it changes credentials or the account email), unlimited password guesses, weak crypto on moderately sensitive data, a leak of internal details.
- 1-3: reachable only by an already-privileged or local actor, or defense in depth only.
