# commit-context.sh - prints the context the commit fork composes its message
# from: the resolved selector, the issue footer, the branch, the recent commit
# subjects (the repo's type/scope style to match), and the git status and diff of
# the selected set, the diff capped so it cannot flood the fork's context.
#
# It exists so the fork gets everything in one `!` preload instead of composing
# git calls itself, and so the set it measures is resolved by the same parser
# (commit-args.sh) commit.sh stages with.
#
# Usage:
#   commit-context.sh [selector]
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : $1 selector (optional) - the skill's whole raw argument string,
#            resolved as in commit-args.sh: ""/all -> all, existing paths ->
#            paths (the context narrowed to them), named paths none of which
#            exists -> missing. SKILL.md passes it single-quoted
#            ('$ARGUMENTS'): Claude Code substitutes the text before the shell
#            runs, so only single quotes keep $, backticks and backslashes
#            literal - an apostrophe in the arguments breaks the preload.
#   cwd    : any directory inside the repository to commit in; the script
#            moves to its root, so every git call and every path it prints is
#            root-relative (see commit-args.sh).
#   env    : none.
#   stdout : markdown sections, the "## Selector:" line first; in mode missing
#            that line alone. The diff is capped at MAX_LINES with a notice
#            naming the real total; an empty diff beside a non-empty status
#            (untracked files only) says outright that commit.sh still has
#            work to commit.
#   exit   : 0 in every data condition. Deliberately WITHOUT `set -e`: it is a
#            best-effort preload, and one failed git call must not abort the
#            skill load.
