# bootstrap.sh - seeds the host project for a viber run, and brings a config
# seeded by an older version up to the current template. Idempotent: it never
# overwrites a value the project already carries, so a second run is a no-op
# that still reports the truth.
#
# It is one script rather than a handful of inline commands because a `!` preload
# is permission-checked as ONE command: a compound `test && cp && grep` would ask
# for approval per member and stall the skill load on any mode that does not
# auto-accept.
#
# The config is MERGED rather than left alone, because a new version ships new
# switches: a file seeded once by an older one would never see them, and a user
# reading the README for a switch their own file does not carry has no way to
# turn it on. The merge is additive in one direction only - a key the template
# has and the file lacks is appended with the template's own comment and default
# value; every key the file already declares keeps its value, its comment and
# its position, and a key the template dropped is left standing. Hence `false`
# is the one way to turn a switch off: a deleted or commented-out top-level key,
# or a child of `planning:`, `build:`, `github:` or `directories:`, is restored
# at the template's default the next run. A child of `tiers:` or `branching:` is
# the exception: the merge only appends one of those groups whole when it is
# missing entirely, never extends one already present, so a deleted child there
# is not restored - it just resolves to its default in config.sh.
#
# The one edit that is not additive is the layout migration: a legacy flat
# switch (written at column 0 before the switches were grouped) is moved into
# its group with its own value, and the `schema:` line is added or raised to the
# template's number - never lowered, so a file written by a newer viber keeps
# its number. config.sh reads a switch only inside its group, so a flat line
# left standing would silently count as off.
#
# `build.baseline-tests` takes off, fast or full. A legacy `true` becomes `full`
# and `false` becomes `off` (any letter case, a trailing comment kept) in a moved
# flat line, and in a grouped one only when the file sits below the template's
# schema: a file already at it keeps whatever value it carries.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none.
#   cwd    : any directory inside the host project - the repository root is

#   stdout : one result line per item - the skill carries them into its report
#            verbatim and never re-verifies them. A changed viber.yml prints
#            "migrated to schema <n>: <keys> moved into their groups (your own
#            values kept)" when a flat switch moved, else "schema set to <n>"
#            when only the schema line was added or raised, then
#            "build.baseline-tests <old> -> <new> (the switch takes off, fast or

#            the template: <keys> (your own values kept)" for every group
#            appended or child restored at its default. The settings line is
#            exactly "settings.json: absent", "settings.json: matches the template
#            (left untouched)" (byte-identical to the template) or
#            "settings.json: present" (any difference, or the template missing).
#            The CLAUDE.md line is exactly

# The merge reads the template first and the config second. A key is read with
# config.sh's own grammar - blanks allowed before the colon - so a key the
# resolver sees is never taken for a missing one and appended a second time,
# which would override the user's value there. In one pass it:
#  - moves every legacy flat switch (a column-0 key the template now keeps in
#    a group) into its group with its value: the key line and the comment
#    block directly above it go, and a blank line left doubled by the removal
#    goes with them. A grouped twin already in the file wins and the flat line
#    is only dropped. A flat key whose group carries a value rather than a
#    group is left where it is: there is nowhere safe to move it.
#  - adds the template's `schema:` block when the config has none (above the
#    first top-level key it keeps, else first among the appended blocks), and
#    raises a lower or non-numeric number in place; a higher one stands.
#  - appends the block of every other top-level key the config does not
#    declare - the key line plus the comment lines directly above it - a moved
#    value replacing the template default of its child.
#  - inserts the missing children of the `planning:`, `build:`, `github:` and
#    `directories:` groups inside that group, after its last child, with the
#    child's own comment: a moved value where there is one, else the default.
#    A group carrying a value rather than children is left untouched: only the
#    shape the template ships can be extended safely. `tiers:` and `branching:`
#    are appended whole when absent and never extended: a missing child
#    resolves to its default in config.sh.
# A config written with CRLF endings comes back with one ending throughout,
# never a mix: an awk that hands the merge its CR keeps CRLF, one reading in
# text mode (Git-Bash) rewrites the file LF. A mixed file is the one outcome
# that would corrupt it, since a line-based reader takes a stray CR as part of
# the value. It always writes the result to `out`, and prints one report line
# per kind of change only when it changed something: the moved keys, else the
# schema it set, then the keys it added at their default.
