# memory-map.sh - maps the host project's CLAUDE.md cascade, and on --reset
# deletes the nodes and sections it is handed. It is what the memory command loads before

#
# id      - this run's stamp, which the caller spends as .temp/viber/<id>/.
# state   - "none" when no CLAUDE.md is tracked anywhere, "complete" when a
#           root node exists and every candidate directory carries its own
#           node, "partial" otherwise.
# node    - one line per tracked CLAUDE.md still present in the working tree,
#           root first then depth order. The first count is `wc -c` on the
#           file, "chain" that plus every ancestor node up to the root - what
#           a reader loads by the time it reaches this one. OVER-NODE past
#           4000 bytes for the root node CLAUDE.md, which every session
#           loads first, and past 12000 bytes for every other node,
#           OVER-CHAIN past 32000 on the chain, OVER-NODE
#           winning when both hold. A node deleted but not yet committed -
#           staged with `git rm` or plainly `rm`'d - is no node at all: no
#           line here, no dirty line, not counted toward total or state, and
#           its directory is a plain candidate again once it qualifies.
# section - one line per tracked CLAUDE.<topic>.md still present, in the same
#           order: a block of its node moved beside it, read on demand, so it
#           never counts toward any chain. <topic> is lowercase letters,
#           digits and hyphens; CLAUDE.local.md is the user's own auto-loaded
#           file and never a section. OVER-NODE past 12000 bytes.
# unlinked - a section no reader can reach: no node sits beside it, or the
#            text of that node never names its file.
# orphan  - a node with no other tracked file anywhere beneath its directory,
#           its own sections not counted: it documents nothing.
# cand    - a directory that deserves a node and has none: tracked, no path
#           segment starting with ".", and at depth 1 or 2 at least three
#           tracked files beneath it. Deeper, it directly holds a build
#           manifest (below), or at least twenty tracked files beneath it
#           while it is no passthrough - a directory holding no file of its
#           own and exactly one subdirectory, whose node would only repeat
#           that subdirectory's. The deeper bar is higher because a deep tree
#           carries many small directories a node would not pay for, and the
#           map is read whole on every run. "toolchain" when it directly
#           holds one of package.json, pyproject.toml, setup.py,
#           requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, build.gradle,
#           build.gradle.kts, Gemfile, composer.json, mix.exs, pubspec.yaml,
#           CMakeLists.txt, Makefile, or any *.csproj / *.sln; "plain"
#           otherwise. "files" and "bytes" count every tracked file beneath it.
# dirty   - one line per node or section the git index reports modified, or
#           present in the tree and untracked. An untracked node or section
#           is none anywhere else in the map: it is neither counted nor sized.
#           One deleted but not yet committed carries no working-tree file
#           either way, so it is absent rather than dirty - `--reset` alone
#           still treats its uncommitted deletion as "modified" and refuses to
#           touch it again.
#
# A kind of line with nothing to report prints none at all; "total:" always
# prints, counting nodes only. --reset takes a node or a section; a node
# takes every tracked section beside it along. It judges every file it would
# delete before deleting the first one, so one modified or untracked file
# leaves the whole cascade untouched - a user never loses half a layer.
