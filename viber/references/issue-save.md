# Issue save steps

Input: the `STATUS=ready` block of `issue-templates.sh` and the values the caller names:

- `directory:` - `.temp/viber/<skill>/`, the one place this save writes.
- `eligible:` - `bug`, `non-bug` or `any`: the template kind the save may use.
- `content:` - what fills the title's summary and the body of one issue.
- An issue set names `parent:` and `parts:` in place of `content:`:
  - `parent:` is `new`, or the URL of the existing issue the run is tied to.
  - `parts:` is one entry per roadmap part, in roadmap order, each holding that part's roadmap line, the decisions settled for it and its open unknowns, plus the confirmed summary on this cycle's part.
  - A new parent's title `{summary}` states the whole change and its body holds the accepted roadmap and the confirmed summary. Part `<k>`'s title `{summary}` states that part and its body holds its entry.

`<root>` is the project root. Every file below is written with `Write` to an absolute path under `<root>/<directory>` and passed to its script by that same path: a multi-line text never rides a Bash line.

Result: `ISSUE_URL=<url>` reported, or no issue. An issue set reports every `ISSUE_URL=` that landed, each labelled parent or part `<k>`.

1. Pick the template from the block. A template whose `TYPE` is `Bug` in any letter case is a bug template; with `TYPE` empty judge by `NAME` and `LABELS`. No template of the eligible kind -> say so in one line and end the save: no issue. One eligible template -> take it. Several -> one `AskUserQuestion`, the one that fits the content best first, at most four options, any further one by free text. An issue set makes this one choice for every issue of the set.
2. `Read` the chosen template file (the path on its `--- template` line). Fill each `body` entry that is not `type: markdown` from the content: `dropdown` only with one of its `options`, `checkboxes` only with its option labels. A `validations.required: true` entry the content does not answer -> ask for it in prose, one per message, before the preview. Never invent a value.
3. Title: the `TITLE_PATTERN` value with `{template-title}` replaced by the template's `TITLE`, `{type}` by its `TYPE` and `{summary}` by a one-line statement of the content in the user's language; an empty value empties its placeholder.
4. Body, the format GitHub itself renders from an issue form: per filled entry in template order, `### <attributes.label>`, a blank line, the content, a blank line. `textarea` and `input` take the text; `dropdown` the chosen option; `checkboxes` one `- [x] <label>` or `- [ ] <label>` line per option. An optional entry left empty reads `_No response_`. A `markdown` entry is left out. No secrets, credentials or file contents: the issue may be public. No Claude or Claude Code attribution.
5. Preview: `Write` each body to `<root>/<directory>issue-body-<stamp>.md`, `<stamp>` the output of `date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S`, so every body gets its own file. In an issue set one `<stamp>` serves the whole set and the files are `issue-body-<stamp>-parent.md` for a new parent and `issue-body-<stamp>-<k>.md` for part `<k>`. Print, never the body text, one block per issue (the new parent first, then each part in order) of the lines `Title: <title>`, `Type: <type or ->`, `Labels: <list or ->`, `Assignees: <list or ->`, `Projects: <list or ->`, `Parent: <#N or "this set's parent">` only when the issue has one and `Body: <absolute path of the body file>`.
   - A single issue has a parent when the content names one (a number, or an issue URL of the block's `REPO`): `Parent: #<N>`. In an issue set every part has one: `Parent: this set's parent` under a new parent, else `Parent: #<N>`, `<N>` the number of the existing parent, and the existing parent gets no block.
   - A content or `parent:` naming an issue URL of another repository gets one line saying it cannot be attached and no `Parent` line.
   - Then ask through one `AskUserQuestion`: `Create` or `Do not create`, a correction travelling through its free-text field. A correction -> apply it, `Write` the same files again and preview again. Anything but `Create` or a correction -> no issue.
6. On `Create` run `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/issue-create.sh" "<file>" "<title>"`, `<file>` the body file of step 5, with the template's values appended on the same line: `--type "<TYPE>"` when `TYPE` is not empty, one `--label "<L>"` per `LABELS` item, one `--assignee "<A>"` per `ASSIGNEES` item, one `--project "<P>"` per `PROJECTS` item, `--parent "<N>"` when the preview carries a `Parent` line. An issue set creates a new parent first, with no `--parent`, then each part in order with `--parent "<N>"`, `<N>` the `ISSUE_NUMBER=` of the new parent or the number of the existing one.
   - Exit 0 -> report `ISSUE_URL=`. `TYPE=dropped` or `TYPE=error` -> one line naming the type left off and its `TYPE_ERROR=`; the issue stands. `PARENT=error` -> one line saying the issue was not attached under `#<N>` and its `PARENT_ERROR=`; the issue stands, and an issue set goes on with the next part.
   - Exit 1 -> report its `ERROR` line and say whether an issue landed is unknown. Never retry. No issue URL is known. An issue set stops here: it creates no further issue and reports every `ISSUE_URL=` that landed before.
   - Exit 2 -> report its `ERROR` line. No issue URL is known. An issue set stops here the same way.
