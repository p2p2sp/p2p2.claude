# switch-text.sh - prints the skill fragment matching one .claude/viber.yml
# switch value, so a loaded skill holds only the instructions of the
# configuration the project turned on.
#
# It exists because a skill body branching on a switch makes the model read and
# track the text of every feature the project turned off. Each switch-dependent
# passage lives in its own fragment file, one per state that does something, and
# the skill preloads it through this script at the place the text belongs. The
# script only SELECTS the file; it never composes text. The value comes from
# config.sh, the one parser of viber.yml, so a fragment follows exactly the value
# every other preload sees.
#
# A preload's output is never substituted by Claude Code, so the two root
# placeholders a fragment may carry are expanded here: the skill directory is
# handed in, and the plugin root is derived from it (a skill lives at
# <plugin root>/skills/<name>).
