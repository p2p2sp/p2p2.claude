# config.sh - resolves the .claude/viber.yml switches into the block a skill
# preloads when it loads.
#
# It exists because a grep|sed YAML parser is a compound command, and Claude
# Code asks for approval on every member of one - which stalls the step on any
# permission mode that does not auto-accept everything. One script is ONE
# command to the permission engine. It is also the only way `implementor` can
# read the file at all: that skill's body forbids it to open a file.
#
# The file is resolved against the REPOSITORY ROOT, not the caller's cwd: a `!`
# preload runs wherever the session started, and a session started in a
# subdirectory would otherwise find no file and fail open with every switch
# false - silently turning off every layer the user configured.
#
# Every key lives INSIDE its group, and the group is the disambiguation: `runs`
# on its own reads like a count and `memory` like anything, where
# `directories.runs` and `build.memory` cannot be read as anything else, so a
# key of that name outside its group is not this key and is ignored - a legacy
# flat switch included, until /viber:setup moves it. A directory value is
# sanitized because "docs/ is the one home for persisted knowledge" rests on
# it: a slash, a traversal or an absolute path is a configuration error, so the
# default stands and the run is unaffected.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : none -> the block below. `--branching` -> the branching report
#            (see its own stdout paragraph) in place of the block. Anything else
#            -> the block.
#   cwd    : any directory inside the host project - the repository root is
#            resolved here. Outside a repository, the cwd is the base.
#   env    : none.
#   file   : <repo root>/.claude/viber.yml (optional). No file -> every switch
#            false, every other key at its default.
#   keys   : A group is `<group>:` at column 0; its children are the indented
#            key lines below it, the group ending at the next column-0 key (a
#            blank line or a column-0 comment leaves it open). The first
#            assignment of a child wins; a CR is never part of a value.
#            planning.adr, planning.plain-plan-review, planning.fast-path,
#            build.baseline-tests, build.final-review, build.memory,
#            build.rules, build.qa, build.cleanup, github.issues - switches.
#            One is `true` ONLY as a child of its own group, spelled exactly
#            (case-sensitive), whose value is `true` in any letter case (ended
#            by a space, a comment or the end of the line). A column-0 key of
#            the same name, the key under another group, or an absent key ->
#            false.
#            build.baseline-tests is the one three-valued switch, read the same
#            group-bound way: `full` or `true` (any letter case) -> full, `fast`
#            (any letter case) -> fast, `false`, any other value, an absent key,
#            a column-0 key or the key under another group -> off.
#            github.issue-title (default `{summary}`) and
#            github.pr-title (default `[{issue-number}] {summary}`) - title patterns,
#            children of `github:`. A value opening on a quote with its
#            closing pair -> everything between the two, kept whole; otherwise
#            cut at the first blank followed by `#`, trailing blanks dropped.
#            Empty, a comment alone or absent -> the default.
#            build.extensions - a map of agent entries, owned by the first
#            `extensions:` key line among the indented lines of `build:`:
#              build:
#                extensions:          # empty or a comment after the colon
#                  <name>:            # an entry
#                    parallel: true   # an option of that entry
#            A value after the key other than a comment -> no entry. Map lines
#            run from the line after the key up to the first line that is
#            neither blank nor a comment and is indented no deeper than the key
#            (a column-0 line included); no map line is a child of `build:` for
#            any other key. The first key line of the map sets the entry depth:
#            a key line there is an entry named by its trimmed key, any inline
#            value ignored; a deeper key line is an option of the entry above,
#            a shallower one is ignored. `parallel` reading `true` in any letter
#            case (cut at a blank or a `#`) makes the entry parallel; any other
#            value, an absent option or another option key -> not parallel, and
#            the first `parallel` of an entry wins. A name counts once, at its
#            first entry, with that entry's option. A name matching
#            `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` whose file <repo root>/.claude/agents/<name>.md
#            exists is found; every other name (no such file, or an invalid
#            name) is missing. A CR is never part of a key or a value. Absent,
#            an empty map or a map outside `build:` -> no name.
#            directories.runs (default `_specs`) and
#            directories.specifications (default `specs`) - the directory names
#            under docs/ holding the open runs and the archived ones. Read ONLY
#            from inside the `directories:` group: `directories:` at column 0,
#            its keys indented under it, the group ending at the next top-level
#            key. A same-named key outside the group is ignored. The value is
#            the first such assignment, cut at the first space or `#`, and must
#            match `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` and be neither `.` nor `..`; anything else
#            -> the default, silently.
#            tiers.min (default `haiku`) and tiers.max (default `opus`) - the
#            model range implementor clamps its dispatches into. Read the same
#            group-bound way; the value is one of haiku, sonnet, opus, fable (any
#            case). The default max stays opus: fable is reached only when a
#            project names it. Anything else -> that key's default; min above
#            max -> both defaults.
#            branching.mode (default `off`) - whether a run works on its own
#            branch. Read the same group-bound way; off, allowed or required
#            (any case, printed lowercase), anything else -> off. The branch
#            bases and name patterns live in `branching.work` entries, read by
#            `--branching` alone.
#   file   : <repo root>/.claude/viber.local.yml (optional, the same layout and
#            key grammar, personal and git-ignored; outside a repository
#            .claude/viber.local.yml under the cwd). It overrides exactly four
#            keys: tiers.min and tiers.max (haiku, sonnet, opus or fable, any
#            case), build.baseline-tests (off, fast, full, true -> full,
#            false -> off) and github.issues (true or false). A valid local
#            value replaces that one key; an empty or invalid one leaves the
#            shared value. The min-above-max reset runs on the merged range.
#            Every other direct child of any group, and every column-0 key
#            carrying a value, is ignored. A direct child is a key line at the
#            indentation of the first key line inside its group; a deeper line
#            is neither read nor named. The first assignment of a key wins, and
#            a key is named once however often the file repeats it.
#            `--branching` never reads this file.
#   stdout : a header line, then one `<group>.<key>: <true|false>` line per
#            switch (`build.baseline-tests: <off|fast|full>`), one `github.<key>: <pattern>` line per title,
#            the two extension lines, one
#            `directories.<key>: <name>` line per directory key, one
#            `tiers.<key>: <tier>` line per tier key and the
#            `branching.mode: <mode>` line - dotted, so the block reads the
#            way the file does - in a fixed order:
#              # viber config (resolved)
#              planning.adr: true
#              planning.plain-plan-review: true
#              planning.fast-path: true
#              build.baseline-tests: off

#              build.memory: true
#              build.rules: true
#              build.qa: false

#              github.issues: false
#              github.issue-title: {summary}
#              github.pr-title: [{issue-number}] {summary}
#              build.extensions: <step>, <step> | none
#              build.extensions-missing: <name>, <name> | none
#              directories.runs: _specs
#              directories.specifications: specs
#              tiers.min: haiku
#              tiers.max: opus
#              branching.mode: off
#            Missing names are dropped before the found ones are grouped, so a
#            missing name never splits a run. A <step> is a run of consecutive
#            found parallel entries joined by ` + `, or one found entry that is
#            not parallel, alone (a parallel entry with no parallel neighbour is
#            a step of one name). build.extensions holds the steps,
#            build.extensions-missing the missing names, each in listed order
#            joined by `, `, `none` when there is none. Example: `a` and `b`
#            parallel, `c`, `d` parallel, `ghost` missing, `e` parallel ->
#            `build.extensions: a + b, c, d + e` and
#            `build.extensions-missing: ghost`.
#            When the local file exists, one line follows the header:
#              # local: <overridden> | ignored: <ignored>
#            <overridden> is the keys that took a local value, in block order,
#            joined by `, ` (`none` when empty); <ignored> the ignored keys in
#            file order (a group child as <group>.<key>, a column-0 key as
#            <key>), joined by `, ` (`none` when empty). Every other line is
#            unchanged. An unreadable local file reads as `none` twice.
#   stdout (--branching): the `branching:` group read by indentation - its
#            direct children are `mode`, `work` and `issue-type-mappings`; a
#            child of `work` is one work entry, its own `base`, `name` and
#            `target` fields below it; a child of `issue-type-mappings` maps an
#            issue type to an entry key. Values are cut at the first space or
#            `#`. Lines, in this order:
#              mode: off|allowed|required
#              entry: <key> | base: <branch> | name: <pattern> | target: <branch>
#              map: <issue type> | <entry key>
#              error: <reason>
#            mode as in the block. `entry:` once per valid work entry, `map:`
#            once per mapping naming a valid entry, each in file order. Entry
#            key `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`; base and target `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+`, not
#            starting with `-` or `/`, no `..`; name with one surrounding quote
#            pair stripped, `[A-Za-z0-9._/{}-]+`; an issue type with one
#            surrounding quote pair stripped, kept verbatim. `error:` lines, in
#            this order, zero or more:
#              branching.base and branching.name are no longer read - move them into a branching.work entry
#                (a `base:` or `name:` directly under `branching:`)
#              work entry <key>: invalid key: <key>
#              work entry <key>: missing <base|name|target>
#              work entry <key>: invalid <base|name|target>: <value>
#              work entry <key>: {issue} is now {issue-number}
#                (each of these drops the entry; one entry may print several,
#                its fields checked in base, name, target order)
#              issue-type-mappings: <type> names no work entry: <key>
#                (the mapping is dropped)
#              no valid branching.work entry
#                (a mode other than off only)
#            No file or no group -> `mode: off` alone.
#   exit  : ALWAYS 0 (fail-open - a missing file or key never breaks a run, and
#            a non-zero exit in a `!` preload would abort the whole skill load).
