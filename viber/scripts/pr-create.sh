#
# Pushes the current branch with its upstream set and opens a pull request for
# it in one deterministic step: `git push -u <remote> <branch>` -> `gh pr
# create` -> parse the printed URL. It exists so `create-pr` publishes through
# ONE pre-approved command, and so the push is never repeated or skipped by a
# model deciding step by step. Self-verifying: PR_URL is printed only after gh
# returned a well-formed pull request URL - the caller trusts the block without
# re-checking.
#
# Contract:
#   argv : $1 = body file path, $2 = title, then in any order:
#            --base <branch>   the branch the pull request targets (required)
#            --draft           open the pull request as a draft (optional)
#   cwd  : the repository whose current branch is published; gh resolves the
#          repository from it too. A relative body file resolves against it.
#   env  : none of its own; git and gh read their usual auth and config.
#   file : $1, sent verbatim as the pull request body; never modified.
#   remote: `branch.<branch>.remote`, else `origin`. Push: `git push -u
#          <remote> <branch>`. Create: `gh pr create --base <base> --head
#          <branch> --title <title> --body-file <file>` plus `--draft`.
#   stdout, exit 0:
#            PR_URL=https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<N>
#            PR_NUMBER=<N>
#            PUSHED=<remote>/<branch>
#   exit 1: one ERROR line on stderr, nothing on stdout - the push failed
#           (nothing was created), or `gh pr create` failed or printed no pull
#           request URL (the ERROR line names the branch as pushed).
#   exit 2: one ERROR line on stderr - missing body file or title, body file
#           not found, no --base, an unknown or valueless flag, gh missing or a
#           detached HEAD; nothing is pushed and gh is never invoked.
