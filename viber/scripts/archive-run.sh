# archive-run.sh - moves a finished run's lasting work out of the runs
# directory and into the archive, dropping the scaffolding the build needed
# only while it was running, and commits the move.
#
# A run directory is two things at once: the specification and the QA documents,
# which are worth reading months later, and the plan, the state file, the task
# decomposition and the trail - all of which duplicate what git already holds.
# Left whole, the second half buries the first. This script keeps the first and
# removes the second in one commit, so the archive reads like a specification
# rather than like a process log.
#
# It exists as a script rather than as a few lines in an agent for the reason
# every deterministic step here does: the operation is fixed (git, a basename,
# an enumerated list of paths), and a hand-composed `git mv` plus `git rm` is
# exactly the composition that deletes the wrong tree when the run is not shaped
# the way the caller assumed. The two gates below are the whole point - the
# caller is refused rather than corrected.
#
# The directory is MOVED, never copied file by file, and the caller edits
# spec.md BEFORE calling, so both sides of the move land in ONE commit and what
# the build changed about the specification is an ordinary diff in the history.
# That is why there is no changelog here - the history is the changelog. Git's
# rename detection then pairs the two sides whenever the edit left the file
# recognisably itself, which a few markers and a closing section on a real
# specification do; a very short spec rewritten more than half over falls under
# git's own 50% threshold and reads as an add plus a delete until `git log -M30`
# or `--follow` is asked for it. The commit is the same either way.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : $1 run directory (REQUIRED), repository-relative, exactly as
#            plan-path.sh printed its `path:` line minus `/plan.md`. The safety
#            gate rejects every path outside docs/<runs>/, an absolute one and
#            one carrying a `..` segment included: that is not a typo to fix up,
#            it is the signal that the caller is outside this script's contract.
#   cwd    : any directory inside the host repository - the script moves to the
#            repository root itself, because the argument is relative to it.
#            Outside a repository the cwd is the base every path resolves
#            against and is left untouched.
#   env    : none. GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS is exported here, never read.
#   file   : <repo root>/.claude/viber.yml (optional) - `runs` and
#            `specifications` inside its `directories:` group, resolved and
#            sanitized exactly as config.sh resolves them, defaulting to
#            `_specs` and `specs`. An unusable value is ignored.
#   stdout : ALWAYS exactly one line, and never anything else - every byte of
#            git noise goes to stderr:
#              ARCHIVED: docs/specs/<key> (<n> files)
#              ARCHIVED: docs/specs/<key> (<n> files - no git repository)
#            <key> is the run directory's own name, kept unchanged, so a second
#            build of the same area lands beside this one and nothing is ever
#            merged or overwritten. <n> counts the files the archive holds after
#            the scaffolding is gone.
#   exit != 0:
#     2 - unusable argv: no argument, more than one, a directory that does not
#         exist, or one the safety gate refuses (outside docs/<runs>/, carrying
#         a `..` segment, or holding no status.md)
#     3 - the destination already exists; nothing is touched
#     4 - the run is unfinished: a task of plan.md is in neither `done:` nor
#         `skipped:` of status.md; nothing is touched
#     5 - a git step failed. A failing `git mv` is the realistic one and leaves
#         the run exactly where it was; a failure after it leaves the directory
#         moved and the move uncommitted, which `git status` shows.
#
# The scaffolding is an enumerated list - plan.md, status.md, tasks/, work/ -
# so anything else the run left behind travels into the archive on its own,
# without this script having to know what it is.
#
# Once the last run has left, docs/<runs>/ is removed too, before the commit:
# git tracks no directory, so an empty one would only linger in the working
# tree. It goes only when it holds nothing at all - a sibling run or any stray
# file keeps it.
#
