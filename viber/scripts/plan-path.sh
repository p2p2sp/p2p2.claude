# plan-path.sh - resolves the plan file of a build, and on --land puts the
# approved plan there. One dated directory per run:
# docs/_specs/<yyyy-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss>_<slug>/plan.md, the stamp being the moment
# the plan is landed. The decomposition plan-index.sh --split writes (spec.md
# and tasks/T<n>.md) lands in that same directory, so one run is one directory
# and one key.
#
# `_specs` is the DEFAULT name of that directory, not a fixed one: `runs` inside
# the `directories:` group of .claude/viber.yml renames it, resolved here the
# same way config.sh resolves it and fail-open on anything unusable, so every
# example below reads docs/<runs>/ for a project that set the key.
#
# Usage:
#   plan-path.sh --land <src>              land <src> as this run's plan
#   plan-path.sh --land <src> --into <key> land <src> into that existing draft;
#                                          without --into, a frontmatter
#                                          "into: <key>" line in <src> does the same
#   plan-path.sh                           no argument: the plan most recently
#                                          worked on
#   plan-path.sh --branch <plan>           read-only report on the run branch
#                                          situation for <plan> (C3); nothing
#                                          moves, nothing is written
#   plan-path.sh --start [<issue URL>]     read-only start report (C1) needing no
#                                          plan: the same situation as --branch
#                                          from the issue URL alone, ending in
#                                          /issues/<n>; nothing moves, nothing
#                                          is written
#   plan-path.sh --checkout <branch>       put HEAD on an existing local branch
#                                          (C2); never creates one, never fetches
#
# <src> is the approved plan as plan mode wrote it. Its directory is a user-level
# setting ("plansDirectory"), so the file normally sits OUTSIDE this repository:
# it is copied, never moved, and the source is left untouched. The slug comes
# from the plan's own first H1, falling back to its file name when there is no
# H1 or the H1 normalizes to nothing (a non-Latin script), and is normalized
# here - lowercased, every other run of characters collapsed to "-", 60 chars
# max - so no caller has to form one. The copy is stripped of the template's
# guidance comments on the way in: everything the run itself reads stays
# (<!-- TASK -->, <!-- /TASK -->, and <!-- source: --> for a plan written before
# that path moved into the frontmatter), the rest would only ride through
# spec.md and every task file into the build. A fenced block (``` or ~~~ up to
# the closing fence of the same character) is content, not guidance: every line
# of it, comments and blank lines included, is copied through untouched. The
# frontmatter is not a comment and survives whole but for its "source:" line,
# which the copy rewrites to its own absolute path.
#
# --into names ONE directory under docs/<runs>/ - no slash, no "." and no ".." -
# and that directory has to be a DRAFT - a run whose plan carries not one task
# block and that holds no decomposition or progress, so nothing was ever built
# from it - OR a run whose plan.md already holds the source's own plan, a round
# already turned into a run, decomposed or not. Over a draft the round lands
# in place, keeping the key and the stamp, which is what lets a draft go
# through several rounds of remarks and still be one run. Landing the SAME
# round a second time, before or after it was decomposed or committed from,
# copies nothing and answers "state: existing" rather than refusing it - the
# whole point of --land's idempotence surviving a context cleared between
# rounds, and what lets a build resume through the plan's source: line. A
# source that actually differs from what a target with a task half, a
# decomposition or recorded progress already holds, and any source over a draft
# carrying a decomposition or progress, is refused (exit 4) rather than
# overwritten.
#
# The run branch. Under a branching.mode other than off (config.sh --branching,
# read by the sourced run-branch.sh; outside a git repository it acts as off), a
# FIRST landing - a plan-mode source, or a draft round through --into - validates
# argv and the --into target first, then puts HEAD on the run branch, and only
# then looks up runs by slug and copies: a run already open on that branch is
# found there rather than minted again beside it. The plan's entry is the
# branching.work entry its frontmatter "work:" key names, or the single entry
# when it names none. The run branch is the source's frontmatter "branch:" key
# (up to its first whitespace; "none" is no branch): kept when HEAD is on it,
# switched to when it exists, else created from the local base of the plan's
# entry. With no branch recorded, "allowed" keeps the current branch;
# "required" keeps a branch that is no entry base and, with HEAD on the base of
# any entry, creates the plan's entry name pattern from that entry's base -
# {type} fix when a task block carries a "Repro:"
# line, else feature; {issue-number} the number of the frontmatter "issue:"
# URL, read as commit-task.sh's issue_ref() reads it; {slug} the run slug - a
# run of - _ . left next to a / or at either end dropped, // and -- collapsed.
# Under required a recorded branch equal to any entry base is refused, the
# plan's own entry or another. A switch
# that moves HEAD to another commit is refused on a dirty tree (untracked files
# count); one keeping the commit carries the uncommitted work along. A matching
# round landed again through --into takes the same branch step before answering
# "existing", so a build resumed from the base branch lands back on the run
# branch. The no-argument form and a source
# that is itself a landed run plan never switch. Nothing is ever fetched.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : --land and the source plan, optionally --into and a run key, or
#            --branch and a plan, or --start and optionally an issue URL, or
#            --checkout and a branch name, or nothing.
#   file   : <src>'s frontmatter "into:" key, read only when argv carries no
#            --into, validated and refused exactly as --into. On a first
#            landing, and on --branch, <src>'s frontmatter "branch:", "work:"
#            and "issue:" keys and its task blocks' "Repro:" lines, for the
#            run branch. On every form printing "branch:", the resolved
#            plan's "work:" key, for the "target:" line. On every copy (a new
#            run, an --into draft round, never an "existing" answer), the
#            copy's frontmatter "prototype:" key: the accepted UI mockup it
#            names (C:/, C:\ or POSIX form) is copied to prototype.html in the
#            run directory, overwriting the one a former round left (a copy
#            with no such key removes it); the key keeps its value. A mockup
#            missing, not copied or not removed is one "warning:" line on
#            stderr, the plan landed and exit and stdout unchanged.
#   git    : HEAD moves only in the branch step of a first landing, or of a
#            matching round landed again through --into, or by --checkout,
#            through one checkout; every failure before or inside that step
#            leaves HEAD, the index and the tree as they were. --branch and
#            --start never move HEAD, the index or the tree - they only read.
#   gh     : --branch and --start alone, through issue-facts.sh, for the issue

#         its plan, or on a draft carrying either; nothing was
#         written. The same source landing over that task half again,
#         unchanged apart from its own source: line, is exit 0 with "state:
#         existing" instead - see "existing" below
#     5 - the copy failed; nothing was landed
#     6 - the run branch could not be set: a switch to another commit on a
#         dirty tree, a base missing locally, an invalid branch name, any entry
#         base as target under required ("branching is required and the run
#         branch is a work entry base: <branch>"), a detached HEAD under required with no
#         branch recorded, or a branch to create while the plan's entry does
#         not resolve ("the plan records no branching.work entry and several
#         exist", "no valid branching.work entry", a "work:" key naming no
#         entry) or its pattern needs the issue the plan lacks ("work entry
#         <key> needs an issue for {issue-number}"), or a branch to create
#         while config.sh --branching reports an error (the first one is the
#         reason); stderr names the reason; nothing landed, HEAD, index and
#         tree unchanged. A recorded branch that exists is kept or switched to
#         whatever those errors are.
#
# One "open:" line per OTHER run still holding a task that is neither committed
# nor skipped - the resolved run is never among them, and a repository with
# nothing else half-built prints none. The counter shown is committed over total,
# so a run closed by dropping its last task reads as finished and disappears.
# A build resumes from the plan it was given; a second run left unfinished is the
# one thing the caller cannot see for itself, and it decides whether landing this
# plan is a switch or a fresh start. Progress is read the same way everywhere: the
# done list out of the run's status.md, the total out of the plan's own TASK
# blocks.
#
# "new"      - the plan was just copied in, so this run starts here.
# "existing" - a run already open for that slug, carrying its own progress in the
#              status.md beside its plan; a run whose every task is committed or
#              skipped is not open, and the plan lands as "new" beside it. An
#              open run is NEVER overwritten: a source edited
#              after the build started does not reach it, because the landed run
#              is the state. A <src> that already IS a landed plan answers the
#              same way, which makes --land idempotent. A draft of that slug
#              answers only a <src> that is itself a draft; a <src> carrying
#              tasks lands as "new" beside it, the draft left untouched. The
#              same idempotence holds for --into: landing the round that
#              already sits at a target's task half again, unchanged apart
#              from its own source: line, answers "existing" too, whether or
#              not that round has itself been landed before, and whether or
#              not the target is already decomposed or carrying progress
#              (see exit 4).
# "draft"    - "state: draft", the run's plan carrying not one task block, so
#              there is nothing to build yet: a specification still being
#              discussed and rounds away from a task list. It replaces both
#              answers above, because what a caller does with a draft is the same
#              whether it was just landed or found in place. A draft is also never
#              an "open:" line - it holds no task to resume.
