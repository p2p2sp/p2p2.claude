# open-page.sh - opens one local HTML file in the user's default browser, so a
# viber skill hands the user a local page instead of printing its content into
# the session's context, where it would cost tokens on every later turn.
# Callers: `setup` and `help` (the onboarding page, `help` as a `!` preload)
# and `prototype` (the built mockup).
#
# It is a bundled script because the opener differs per platform and a skill
# may only make one pre-approved literal call: `open` on macOS, the Windows
# shell's file handler through `rundll32` from Git Bash (the path converted by
# `cygpath -w`), `wslview` under WSL, `xdg-open` on a Linux desktop. `xdg-open`
# is started in the background, in its own session where `setsid` exists,
# because some desktops keep it alive for the browser's whole lifetime, which
# would hang the calling tool, and a tool that ends its process group on return
# would take the browser with it; its launch is therefore reported, not its
# outcome. A session with no opener (a remote or headless one) gets the path to
# open by hand instead.
#
# Contract:
#   argv   : $1 = the file to open (absolute or relative to the cwd).
#   cwd    : resolves a relative $1 only.
#   env    : DISPLAY, WAYLAND_DISPLAY - either one non-empty means a Linux
#            desktop can take `xdg-open`; both empty skip it.
#   reads  : $1 (existence only).
#   stdout : exactly one line, prefixed with the file's basename:
#              <name>: opened in the browser
#              <name>: the browser did not open - open <path> by hand
#              <name>: no browser to open it - open <path> by hand
#              <name>: missing at <path>
#            <path> is absolute, in the C:/ form on Windows.
#   exit   : 0 on every line above - the caller carries the line into its
#            report and never retries. 2 when $1 is absent (a wiring bug).
